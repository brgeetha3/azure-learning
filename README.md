### <ins> Day-1 | Basics of Cloud Computing | Fundamentals of Azure </ins>

* Data Center -->  It is the collection of servers
* Server --> It is a computer system which has CPU and RAM required to run the applications and processes.
* Replica --> is nothing but a copy
* Few of the companies are still in private cloud because they still use legacy systems (means old or outdated computer system, software, or technology)
* multi cloud - mix of services from AWS, azure or from GCP, it is different from hybrid.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Virtualization, Virtual Machine --> in olden days the full server will be allocating to a person, which is not beneficial to the company hence virtualization concept came into existence. system admin will install the hypervisor software in the server. It implements the concepts of virtualization, it breaks the server logically not physically. the breaks down servers (the logically separated servers) are called as virtual machines. 
* API --> let say Jenkins can be accessed through API and CLI. 
	API means Application Interface which will expose the application using the API, application developers (who ever can be)     allow to access the Jenkins application programmatically because to test the application or to perform some scripting. 
* Regions --> refer to geographic locations where cloud providers have data centers. Each region contains multiple data centers
* Availability Zones --> they are data centers
* Scalability -->  infrastructure scalable
* Elasticity --> Automatic scaling the infrastructure
*  Agility
* High Availability --> making available of the application most of the time (e.g. Instagram, Facebook)
* Fault Tolerance
* Disaster Recovery -->  it is technic or mechanism where you need to have plan or action if something goes wrong, it is 
  having a backup
* Load Balancing --> is to split the load between data centers

### <ins> Day-2 | Getting Started With Azure </ins>
* IAAS - Infrastructure as Service eg - VM, storage, networking, Load balancer - you will take the complete infrastructure and install the required components/software in it. Eg --> companies will take VM, Storage, Networking on top of it you will install SQL database and configure it by your own. So you are only picking up only VM, Storage, Networking.
* PAAS - Platform as service eg - companies will pick up the complete platform like database, SQL, app service - you will configure it and use it
	 Eg --> Directly using SQL service not to procure VM, Storage, Networking
* SAAS - Software as Service 
         Eg --> you will directly get the infrastructure, platform and also get the service, not to configure anything. Best example is - outlook you will 
                pay the subscription and start using. 
* why datacenters are located in different regions because is to avoid latency and downtime. Each data center is availability zone.
